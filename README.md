# Luxor to Unreal for live motion capture production. 
### This project is still a 'work in progress' and currently only shows has a single example showing a method of connecting avatars in UE4 to luxor.
### There is still much that needs to be worked on to make this example more functional. I may improve this project and some of the examples over time, please check back often!
### This project requires Luxor mocap fusion (www.MocapFusion.com). Check the youtube video below for examples showing how to setup for streaming motion capture data from Luxor directly to avatars in Unreal.
